## About

A CMS-like PHP application/portal that I'm creation for a small non-profit music venue by local volunteers. The venue also has two practice rooms for bands to rent. Regular visitors can influence this community/organisation by becoming a member which requires paying a small yearly membership fee. Status: development started a few months ago. I'm revising the code every now and then whenever I learn something new. Ideas/suggestions are more then welcome. I'll try to add a roadmap and more details about the features soon.

Used a lot from <https://github.com/panique/huge> but changed it a bit. It isn't fully OOP anymore a I changed the way it handled views (isn't very practical when developing on IIS). May change this again in the future.
